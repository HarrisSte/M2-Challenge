# Personal Profile Page

# Description
This project is intended to create a profile page to both introduce myself, as well as showcase the projects I have worked on throughout the course of this bootcamp.

You will find there is a brief 'About Me' section where I introduce myself. Below that, you will find clickable images that will bring you to my resume and completed projects. 

At the bottom of the page, you will finally find different ways you can contact me. All of which are clickable links that will bring you to your desired inquiry -- with the exception of my phone number.
