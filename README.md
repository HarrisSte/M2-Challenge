# Personal Profile Page

# Description
This project is intended to create a profile page to both introduce myself, as well as showcase the projects I have worked on throughout the course of this bootcamp.

You will find there is a brief 'About Me' section where I introduce myself. Below that, you will find clickable images that will bring you to my completed projects. There are spaces present marked as 'coming soon' for future assignments I complete throughout the duration of this bootcamp. 

At the bottom of the page, you will finally find different ways you can contact me. All of which are clickable links that will bring you to your desired inquiry -- with the exception of my phone number.

# Contribtions
Those who helped me with developing this page are my tutor, Ben Martin, and both my instructior, Josh Bohde, and TA, Sean McCarthy. I also used resources such as StackOverflow and W3Schools to help guide  me through portions of my code where I was stuck; which was mostly the flexbox portion.
